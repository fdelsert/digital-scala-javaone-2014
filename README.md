README
========

This is a sample project to demonstrate Scala and Java EE 7 for the presentation at **JavaOne 2014**.

Are you new to Java EE 7? Did you know I am the author of [*Java EE 7 Developer Handbook*](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/java-ee-7-developer-handbook)?



Requirements
-------------

* [**Scala 2.11**](http://scala-lang.org/download/)
 
* [**GlassFish 4.1 application server**](https://glassfish.java.net/)

* [**Gradle 2.0**](http://www.gradle.org/downloads)

    * If you use Mac OS X or Linux then you can install Gradle using the [**GVM Groovy Environment Manager**](http://gvmtool.net/). GVM can also install Groovy, Grails, Griffon, etc


Installation
--------------

Download in stall GlassFish 4.0 some where


> unzip  ~/Downloads/glassfish-4.0.1-b05-20140427.zip  -d /Library/opt
  

Configure your IDE to installation directory for GlassFish 4. 


> echo $GLASSFISH_HOME
/Library/opt/glassfish-4.0.1-b05-20140427


Download Gradle 2.0 or on the Mac OS X, install using the GVM tool. With Gradle set up and configured to your PATH
environmment variable, the following commands should work:


Generate IntelliJ projects file with the following command:

> gradle idea

Generate NetBeans projects file with the following command:

> gradle netbeans

Generate Eclipse projects file with the following command:

> gradle eclipse


To clean out the project, here is the command:

> gradle clean

In order to build, the entire project with Gradle use the following command:

> gradle build

To executes the tests in the project, use this following command:

> gradle test

If you simply want to see the WAR file, then execute this command:

> gradle war


Gradle creates it output in the `build` folder.



Tested and Verified
---------------------

Tested with WildFly 8.1 *DONE*
Tested with GlassFish 4.0 *DONE*


GlassFish 4.0 JMS Queue
-------------------------

JMS Set up


First, start the application in IDEA or Eclipse that will launch the GlassFish application server. Otherwise, start
GlassFish manually on your workstation. 

Navigate to the GlassFish Administration console [http://localhost:4848/common/index.jsf](http://localhost:4848/common/index.jsf)

On the left hand pane, of the Admin page select the JMS node, then choose JMS Connection Factory. Create a new
connection factory with the following information:


> JNDI name:          jms/OrderQueueConnectionFactory
> Resource type:      javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory
> Description:        <BLANK>


Save this new JMS connection factory.


Now select JMS node again and then choose Destination Resources. Create a new JMS destination with the following 
properties: 

> JNDI name:                      jms/OrderQueue
> Physical Destination NAME:      OrderQueue
> Resource type:                  java.jms.Queue
> Description:                    <BLANK>

Save this new JMS queue.




Redeploy the WAR file again and/or restart the GlassFish server. The application should now complete successfully 
when the customer declares yes on the final wizard step. 



Miscellany
------------

Are you using Intelli J 13.1 on Mac OS X and GlassFish 4.1?

After upgrading to GlassFish 4.1, I found a strange error run a local managed server GlassFish execution: glassfish Server is not connected. Deploy is not available.

The solution is to change the JVM Setting that IntelliJ runs under from (Apple) JDK 1.6 to JDK 1.7 or 8. If you change it suddenly you will get Retina edition font rendering as a bonus

Developing Java EE 7 Applications with Scala (CON2644)
-------------------------------------------------------

*Speakers: Peter Pilgrim*

Title can only be  80 characters long

Abstract: 750 words

Scala is an alternative JVM language with both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. Scala development with the Java EE 7 platform is definitely possible and can be a pleasant experience. If you have uncertainty about how Scala can fit around the Java EE 7 platform, then this session aims to illustrate the huge benefit that Scala adoption can bring to the platform. Many other developers are taking advantage and the challenge of the JVMâ€™s capability of being a vessel for multi-language programming. You no longer have to write every single project using Java, even if you like Lambdas experiences. 

For the developer and engineering terms that feeling a little braver than usual, Scala is attractive as it is strongly typed and lets you set the gauge on how object oriented or how functional you want to be. You will learn how to reuse the annotations and creating Scala plain object safely and concisely. 

This session will highlight and contrast the experience I had developing Scala solutions with Java EE, and there will be plenty of advice about using the functional programming features against the Java object oriented API. 

* Scala language overview
* Java EE 7 architecture and design
* WildFly 8 application server 
* Using Gradle as a build tool
* How to create beans in Scala with dependency injection
* JAX-RS endpoints
* Servlet Endpoints
* JMS Messaging (not enough time to show in the technical session)
* Scala adoption advice and hints for sustainable team development
