*Speakers: Peter Pilgrim*

Title can only be  80 characters long

Abstract: 750 words

Scala is an alternative JVM language with both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. Scala development with the Java EE 7 platform is definitely possible and can be a pleasant experience. If you have uncertainty about how Scala can fit around the Java EE 7 platform, then this session aims to illustrate the huge benefit that Scala adoption can bring to the platform. Many other developers are taking advantage and the challenge of the JVMâ€™s capability of being a vessel for multi-language programming. You no longer have to write every single project using Java, even if you like Lambdas experiences. 

For the developer and engineering terms that feeling a little braver than usual, Scala is attractive as it is strongly typed and lets you set the gauge on how object oriented or how functional you want to be. You will learn how to reuse the annotations and creating Scala plain object safely and concisely. 

This session will highlight and contrast the experience I had developing Scala solutions with Java EE, and there will be plenty of advice about using the functional programming features against the Java object oriented API. 

* Scala language overview
* Java EE 7 architecture and design
* WildFly 8 application server 
* Using Gradle as a build tool
* How to create beans in Scala with dependency injection
* JAX-RS endpoints
* Servlet Endpoints
* JMS Messaging (not enough time to show in the technical session)
* Scala adoption advice and hints for sustainable team development
